In order to field new technologies and capabilities faster and within budget, new approaches are needed to efficiently locate, fund and acquire the latest emerging, cutting edge technologies and manufacturing capabilities that reside in U.S. companies. Because the Connectory.com® is a proven business-to-business resource that provides information on company capabilities, capacities, technologies and expertise, it will enable DoD to objectively compare and analyze technological capabilities across the industrial community to address DoD requirements, particularly limited production items. Since the federal government's official database, the Central Contactor Registry (CCR), contains more California-based companies than any other state, it is important to capture more completely their capabilities and capacities.\n                            "),a("br"),a("br"),e._v("\n                            In order to field new technologies and capabilities faster and within budget, new approaches are needed to (1) efficiently locate, fund and acquire the latest emerging cutting edge technologies that reside in U.S. companies, and (2) objectively compare and analyze technological capabilities across the industrial community before selecting and funding the development of new technology to address vital Defense needs.
